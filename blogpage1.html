        Another erasmus with Filip, but now further away and our first time flying. No exact plan, only thing we booked were our flight tickets and lets go to Italy!<br>
        We take off, look at eachother in joy and suck in our asscheecks during every turbulance. Bari is very nice city except the piss smelling streets which made us felt uhhh, safe.
        We left our bags at friends airbnb and went for an Italian dinner. I don't how and why but we ended up in McDonalds, the perfect place for pasta and some seafood.
        We take our cheeseburger pizzas out to the now cleaned golden streets and eat our midnight food right in front of the opera house, museum or something that is here longer than dinosaurs.

        I didn't mention that me and filip, we didn't have place to stay overnight.<br>
        As the most experienced travellers and enthusiastic explorers of the unexpected we decided to spent night in the city enjoy and try to not get robbed.
        My phone rang, it was text from our belongings keepers, "come to the beach there are people playing voleyball",
        bought some water and then right under the net. It was strange place, it was combination of so-called park, beach and garbage.
        First round of good serves earned us beers from our italian co-voleyballers. After another round we were left on the beach alone, only me, Filip and Italians. 
        Rotations and during time-breaks we drank Jegerbombs and more Peroni. Although voleyball is life it gets boring after 4 hours.
        Net packed and we were thinnking that now we will be left here alone. We were wrong, when guys started to move garbage bins to create artificial goals and joint started passing by
        we knew fun wasn't over yet. We played, easy, hard, drunk, high, noone knew how long and there wasn't anyone who would care about time.
        Feet scratched from garbage in the sand but mainly bottle caps, calves so tense from whole night of olympic games,
        we finaly sat down. Light was slowly dragging from under the sea horizont and we were quikly getting cold.<br>
        Sitting there with bunch of half strangers, tired as hell watching sunrise I felt content. It was like prayer or meditating state, gratitude was
        filling your head and the sole feeling of conscioucusnes in that moment was magical.
        As if it wasn't enough we went to swim in the sea.
        Sun still wasn't completely above the water, as we were stripping down we were shaking from cold but we wanted to experience this so so mutch.
        There was a little rock island about 50 meters from the shore, we swum/walked through the bay only rule was to keep body in the water, it was warmer than the air,
        stood up on the rocks and enjoyed. The sunrise, and the moment.
