        Another erasmus with Filip, but now further away and our first time flying. No exact plan, only thing we booked were our flight tickets and lets go to Italy!<br>
        We take off, look at eachother in joy and suck in our asscheecks during every turbulance. Bari is very nice city except the piss smelling streets which made us felt uhhh, safe.
        We left our bags at friends airbnb and went for an Italian dinner. I don't how and why but we ended up in McDonalds, the perfect place for pasta and some seafood.
        We take our cheeseburger pizzas out to the now cleaned golden streets and eat our midnight food right in front of the opera house, museum or something that is here longer than dinosaurs.
